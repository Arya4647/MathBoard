## Purpose of this project
This is a calculator that does more than just take a string and evaluate it 

I have made this as I feel software calculators are very basic and could do much more.

You may ask what more, that is what the project is for 

It is not a complete app, nor was it meant to be

It is an experiment I conducted to add some features that I would like to have in the calculator.

And I in no way am I an app developer, nor do I want to be

I am an electronics guy, so code may be inconsistent for just bad, IDK

It works as I intend it to work

And please don't judge this project as a completed project

## Major features
- Shows latex expression ,for better readablity
- Variable assignment
- support for constants in variables.js
- easy greek alphabet access(by menu and "alt + key" check variables.js)
- history editing by arrow keys and recalculate
- toggle pin to pin a expression which would be remove with clear
- inerst expression to correct errors
- import forumales with one example in forumla folder
- A parrellel function for us circuit designers
- display: to add [some explaination]
## Features I wanted to add but could because of end of college holiday
- Using derivative function math.js
- support if vectors and matrixs
- To not launch on broswer
- export the latex as pdf
- graphing  2D functions
## Features I wanted to add but could because lack of coding knewledge and spended too much time on this
- custom operator support,please help me do this
- Latex input ,like in desmos I don't what to call it but something like desmos's input field
- graphing vectors and complex number
- get the graphing as strong as desmos (just 2D)
## Future
I may not work on this further due to college and in next holiday I will be internships and R&D

I hope someone more skilled in code contiunes this project, to take this idea furthur and if think you want to please let me know at least I will happy to see this go furthur
