## Purpose of this project
This is a calculator that does more than just take a string and evaluate it 

I have made this as I feel software calculators are very basic and could do much more.

You may ask what more, that is what the project is for 

It is not a complete app, nor was it meant to be

It is an experiment I conducted to add some features that I would like to have in the calculator.

And I in no way am I an app developer, nor do I want to be

I am an electronics guy, so code may be inconsistent for just bad, IDK

It works as I intend it to work

And please don't judge this project as a completed project
